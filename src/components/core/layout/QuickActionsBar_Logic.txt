/**
 * QuickActionsBar - Reusable horizontal bar with configurable quick-access buttons.
 *
 * DYNAMIC RESIZING LOGIC:
 * To ensure the toolbar is perfectly responsive without layout shifts:
 * 1. "Ghost" Rendering: We render ALL actions into a hidden visibility:hidden container
 *    to measure their true pixel width before showing them.
 * 2. Measurement: We measure the available width of the main container and the widths
 *    of all individual action buttons.
 * 3. Calculation: We calculate how many buttons can fit in the available space,
 *    reserving space for the "More" dropdown trigger if overflowing.
 * 4. Partitioning: We split the actions into `visibleActions` and `overflowActions`
 *    based on the calculation.
