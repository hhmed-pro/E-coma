apply this Behavior to all the Header Actions & Collaboration Bar :

1. When Top Navigation is Expanded or Collapsed
Behavior: They appear in the Page Header , not in the Top Navigation Bar.
They are fixed to the right side of the screen.
Why: always available in the main navigation.
2. When Scrolled Down
Behavior: They disappear from the Page Header .
Exceptions: If the top navigation is expanded, they might still be visible in the sticky top nav bar depending on its specific configuration, but they are removed from the page content area to reduce clutter.
Summary: They intelligently "jump" between the Top Bar and the Page Header depending on which one is the primary focus, ensuring they are always available but never duplicated.
